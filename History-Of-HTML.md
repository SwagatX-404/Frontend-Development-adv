# üìú History of HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

1. Birth of HTML (1991‚Äì1993)

    Invented by: Tim Berners-Lee (a British scientist at CERN).

    Year: 1991.

    Purpose: To share and link scientific documents across computers using a simple language.

    First version: A basic set of 18 tags (like <p>, <h1>, <a>, <img>).

    In 1993, HTML was published as an Internet Draft by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

2. HTML 2.0 (1995)

    Standardized by the IETF.

    Included basic structure for web pages: forms, text, links, images, and tables.

    This became the first official specification for HTML.

    Still very simple compared to today‚Äôs web.

3. HTML 3.2 (1997)

    Standardized by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), which took over from IETF.

    Added features like:

    Tables

    Applets (Java support)

    More form elements

    Text flow around images

    By this time, the web was starting to look more like modern websites.

4. HTML 4.01 (1999)

    Major upgrade!

    Introduced:

    Frames and iframes

    More complex forms

    CSS integration (separating style from structure)

    Scripting (JavaScript support)

    Became the main standard for a decade.

5. XHTML (2000s)

    XHTML = Extensible HTML, a stricter version of HTML 4.01.

    Written in XML format.

    Required cleaner code (proper closing tags, lowercase, quotes around attributes).

    Goal: Make HTML more structured and compatible with XML.

    But developers found it too strict ‚Üí not very popular.

6. HTML5 (2014 ‚Äì Present)

    Development started in 2008, finalized as a W3C Recommendation in 2014.

    Still being improved today.

    Key Features:

    Semantic tags: <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>

    Multimedia: <audio>, <video>

    Graphics: <canvas>, <svg>

    Forms: new input types (email, date, range, etc.)

    Local Storage (offline storage)

    Geolocation API

    Responsive design (with <meta viewport>)

7. HTML Living Standard (Present & Future)

    Managed by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group).

    Unlike older versions, HTML is now a living standard ‚Üí it keeps updating continuously (no ‚ÄúHTML6‚Äù, ‚ÄúHTML7‚Äù, etc., just HTML).

    Focused on modern web apps, mobile-first, and integrating with CSS & JavaScript better.
